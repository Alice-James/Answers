- The difference between a while loop and a do-while loop is the order in which the loop-continuation-condition is evaluated and the loop body is executed.

- ```java
  import java.util.Scanner;
  
  public class Test {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
          int sum = 0, number = 0;
          do {
              System.out.println("Enter an integer " + "(the input ends if it is 0)");
              number = input.nextInt();
              sum += number;
          } while(number != 0);
      }
  }
  ```
