1. 

   ```
   Enter an amount in double, for example 11.56: 1.99
   Your amount 1.99 consists of
       1 dollars
       3 quarters 
       2 dimes
       0 nickels
       4 pennies
   
   ```

2. One serious problem with this example is the possible loss of precision when casting a double amount to an int remainingAmount. This could lead to an inaccurate result. If you try to enter the amount 10.03, 10.03 * 100 becomes 1002.9999999999999. You will find that the program displays 10 dollars and 2 pennies.
