1. - you donâ€™t have to repeatedly type the same value if it is used multiple times;
   - if you have to change the constant value, you need to change it only in a single location in the source code;
   - a descriptive name for a constant makes the program easy to read

2. ```java
   final int SIZE = 20;
   ```

```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double miles = 100;
        final double KILOMETERS_PER_MILE = 1.609;
        double kilometers = miles * KILOMETERS_PER_MILE;
        System.out.println(kilometers);
    }
}
