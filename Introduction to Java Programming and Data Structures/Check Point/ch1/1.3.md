machine language

# 1.3.2

1. **Assembly language** uses a short descriptive word, known as a mnemonic, to represent each of the
   machine-language instructions.
2. An **assembler** is used to translate assembly-language programs into machine code.

# 1.3.3

1. **High-level languages** are platform independent, which means that you can write a program in a
   high-level language and run it in different types of machines.
2. A program written in a high-level language is called a **source program** or source code.

# 1.3.4

1. An **interpreter** reads one statement from the source code, translates it to the machine
   code or virtual machine code, then executes it right away.
2. A **compiler** translates the entire source code into a machine-code file, and the
   machine-code file is then executed.

# 1.3.5

When a source program is translated into machine code for execution, an interpreted language uses an interpreter while an compiled language uses a compiler.
